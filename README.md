## Spotify Helper

**This is a full stack web application that works with the Spotify Web API to compare playlists. I intend to expand the application to manage playlists and work with additional Spotify functionality.**

ðŸš§Given that this is my most recent side project (started in late January of 2022), it is very much a **work in progress** and just getting started.ðŸš§

### Technical Stack:

- Node.js, Express.js
- Spotify Web API
- React.js
- MongoDB (to be added next)

<hr>

### Next Steps:
- Write database scripts for setting up the database (MongoDB)
- Put playlist track data into the database
- Add client side functionality for playlist comparisons to act as a controller for Spotify actions (i.e. moving songs between playlists)
  - Develop backend as needed to allow for users to make playlist adjustments (via the Spotify API)
- Increase security
  - Streamline authentication
